#+title: CPP Notes

* CPP Notes
- These are my personal C++ notes that I wrote while learning C++ from [[https://learncpp.com/][learncpp]].
- Some sections have been skipped like basic knowledge about functions or things that I already know about.
** Read Notes
- You may directly view the ~notes.org~ file or visit [[https://prayag2.github.io/cpp-notes]] for a better experience.
- The notes are converted to html from org-mode using ~org-html-export-to-html~ function in Emacs.
